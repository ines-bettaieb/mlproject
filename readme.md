# Key Extractor tool with KeyBert and Streamlit
- This Streamlit application uses KeyBert to extract meaningful keywords from text documents.
- KeyBert can be an alternative to bag of words techniques (e.g. Count or Tfidf vectorizers) that might suffer from noisy results.
- KeyBert uses a minimal keyword extraction technique that leverages multiple NLP embeddings and relies on Transformers ðŸ¤— to create keywords/keyphrases that are most similar to a document.
